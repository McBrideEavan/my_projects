# üìä **Roster Consistency and Team Performance Analysis**

**Author:** Eavan McBride  
**Hypothesis:** Higher roster consistency from game to game correlates with higher win percentage.  
**Scope:** Minnesota Wild NHL Season 2025  
**Context:**  
My dad is a big Wild Hockey fan, and during one of our conversations, he mentioned how NHL teams can make trades and roster adjustments up until mid-season. He also noted that teams in the playoffs often have a much different lineup than the one they started the season with. This sparked a curiosity:  
> *Would teams that maintain a more consistent lineup throughout the season perform better on average?*  

This project aims to explore that hypothesis by measuring **roster consistency** game-over-game for the Minnesota Wild during the 2025 NHL season and correlating it with their **win percentage**.

## üìå **Methodology**
### 1. **Data Collection:**

    - Game schedule and rosters are fetched using the NHL Stats API.

    - Roster information is extracted for each game played during the season.

### 2. **Roster Consistency Calculation:**

     - Game-over-game consistency is measured using the Jaccard Similarity Index, which quantifies the overlap of players between consecutive games.

### 3. **Team Performance Metrics:**

    - Win/Loss records and goal differentials are recorded for each game.

### 4. **Correlation Analysis:**

    - Statistical analysis is performed to identify any correlation between roster consistency and team performance.

## üìä **Results and Visualization**
Results are plotted to visually interpret any correlation between consistency and win percentage.

 - Line plots to show changes in roster similarity over the season.

 - Scatter plots to visualize correlation with win percentage.

---

## üîç **Future Improvements**
 - Expand analysis to all NHL teams for broader insight.

 - Include playoff roster stability versus regular season.

 - Account for player-specific impact (e.g., injuries, key trades).
